So as you already know, I go to the University of Waterloo, but get this, I'm not in Co-op. Don't worry though, if you're here to vet me for a job, I do take extended periods off school to work. In fact, I just got back from working a year at [Mortar Data][1] in New York. It kinda changed my life – more on that [here][2]. I'd definitely be willing to do that again.

But I guess you're really here to see what kind of guy I am. Well, I'm a professional fullstack developer and a amateur designer – I spend as much time reading about distributed system as I do about typography. In my personal life, I'm just your average university student. I love music, I have heated, idealistic debates with my roommate, I experiment frequently with [polyphasic sleep][3], and I'm excited about the future. All in all, I'm just your affable Canadian nerd. I have diverse interests and am always willing to learn something new. Drop me a line if you want to grab a beer.

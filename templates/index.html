        Developing for Hadoop is a pain. Unlike software engineers, data scientists have to wait hours to see if their code worked. I imagine it's akin to writing code on punch cards. That's why I came up with Watchtower – a tool that evaluates your Apache Pig scripts locally, instantly feeding you the results.
        </p>
        <p>
        Too often when writing scripts for Hadoop, your script fails after 8 hours because of a one-off error in the final UDF. Watchtower flushes out those errors instantly by running subsets of your data through your entire script.

        Since launching this project with <a href="http://mortardata.com" target="_blank">Mortar Data</a> in July 2013, people have become pretty excited about it. You can see what they're saying <a href="http://bitly.com/bundles/o_1kfe5nkp1/1" target="_blank">here</a>.

        In my 3A term at the University of Waterloo, I decided to take principles of programming languages. Initially I was drawn to it because I'm a huge fan of the professor, <a target="_blank" href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~plragde/">Prabhakar Ragde</a>, but the content drew me in pretty quickly there after.

        I was trying to come up with the predecessor function for Church numerals when I found myself fumbling over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_normal_form#Reduction_strategies" target="_blank">Normal Order Reduction</a>. I built this tool to help illustrate different reduction strategies in order to better understand things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding" target="_blank">Church numerals</a> and the notorious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator#Y_combinator" target="_blank">Y-Combinator</a>.

        Bored at school, I took a couple of days off to build a Bill Clinton meme generator. Since it’s launch, <a href="http://billclintonswag.com" target="_blank">billclintonswag.com</a> has seen moderate success, with over 35 000 photos of Bill Clinton generated. Yup, that’s right. I have a S3 bucket with 35 000 photos of Bill Clinton in it.
        </p>
        <p>
        I recently rewrote the application in Node.js with a proper worker queue. Feel free to browse around the code on GitHub, fork it, make your own swag generating goodness.

          Back in first year, my friend developed a nasty habit of coming into my room drunk at 4am wanting to party. Usually I'd be down, but not when I had 8:30am class. I could've just locked my door to solve the problem, but that isn't very Canadian of me now is it! So NerfDuino 9000 was born.

          It's a Nerfgun hooked up to a laptop via an Arduino. What else needs to be said?
